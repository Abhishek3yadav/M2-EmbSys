### MICROCONROLLER

The microcontroller used is Beagle Bone   Black, a low-cost development platform, based on an ARM Cortex-A8 based processor
 ****
### CCD/ CMOS
 
A CMOS sensor is a digital device. CMOS stands for ‘complementary metal-oxide semiconductor.’ A CMOS sensor converts the charge from a photosensitive pixel to a voltage at the pixel site.
A CCD sensor is a “charged coupled device.” Just like a CMOS sensor, it converts light into electrons. Unlike a CMOS sensor, it is an analog device. 
CMOS sensors have high speed, low sensitivity, and high, fixed-pattern noise.

### JPEG CODEC   

 1 The Photo JPEG codec implements the Joint  Photographic Experts Group.
•	  This codec is great for compressing high-resolution, photographic images, and is also very good for 8-bit grayscale images.
•	It works very well for "slide-show" movies that have a very low frame rate.
•	It has some application for Web video, although other commercial codecs are often preferable for most movies.

### MEMORY CONTROLLER 

It is a digital circuit that manages the flow of data going to and from the computer's main memory. A memory controller is sometimes also called a memory chip controller (MCC) or a memory controller unit (MCU)

### UART

-  A universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter (UART ) is a computer hardware device for asynchronous serial communication in which the data format and transmission speeds are configurable. Specialised UARTs are used for cameras automobiles, smart cards and SIMs.

 ### MULTIPLIER/ACCUMULATOR –
 
 Multiply-accumulate is an important and expensive operation. It is frequently used in digital signal processing and video/graphics applications. As a result, any improvement in the delay for performing this operation could have a positive impact on clock speed, instruction time and processor performance
multiply-accumulate used for -In computing, especially digital signal processing, the multiply–accumulate operation is a common step that computes the product of two numbers and adds that product to an accumulator.

### DMA CONTROLLER -

DMA stands for Direct Memory Access. ... It allows the device to transfer the data directly to/from memory without any interference of the CPU. Using a DMA controller, the device requests the CPU to hold its data, address and control bus, so the device is free to transfer data directly to/from the memory.

### ISO SETTING -

ISO is your camera's sensitivity to light as it pertains to either film or a digital sensor. A lower ISO value means less sensitivity to light, while a higher ISO means more sensitivity.

### CONVERTOR(A2D&D2A) -

Analog-to-digital converter (ADC) takes an Analog wave as an input and converts this wave to a digitally represented output form (A digital-to-analog converter (DAC) essentially does the reverse, converting a digital representation into an Analog form.
ISA bus -    Stands for "Industry Standard Architecture." ISA is a type of bus used in PCs for adding expansion cards. For example, an ISA slot may be used to add a video card, a network card, or an extra serial port. ... However, by the end of the twentieth century, ISA ports were beginning to be replaced by faster PCI and AGP slots
