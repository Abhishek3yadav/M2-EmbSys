# Motion Based Home Automation & Temperature Controller

Home automation usage has been on a rise in the recent times. The aim of this project is to make smarter home automation system which can switch light automatically as well as maintain the temperature of the facility in which it is installed. Password based security of the system is also an integrated part of this project. We have a motion sensor and a temperature sensor mounted on the project board.

# High Level Requirements
- An automation device must be able to handle as many tasks and processes as possible quickly, easily and without errors.
- Proper power supply is needed.
- In case of fluctuating the voltage, In-build Inverter can control the voltage.

# Low Level Requirements
* Sensor shall work according to the given range of the temperature.
* power supply shall not cut at any time
* load shall be 5 volt.
* 
# SWOT ANALYSIS -

## Strength
* Very easy to use.
* Quick installtion.
* Very Reliable.
* Less maintaince.
## Weakness
* Lack of graphical user interface.
* If the mcrocontroller gets reset the system will not work.
* System is very sensitive we have to handle it with care.
## Opportunity
* Since now a days water usage is increasing so much it is very important to save the energy  wastage so this kind of systems are required.
## Threats
* More advance technology is there to overcome this issue.
# 4W'S & 1H
## WHY
* To save energy consumption controller helps save money by limiting the waste of electricity.
## WHO
* Everyone can use this device as for their commercial aur domestic use.
## WHEN
* Whenerver the sensor  gets low/high it starts and stops according to the requirements.
## WHAT
* Results into less manual work which saves human time and energy.
## HOW
* By setting these devices as per the requiement in our home so as to save the loss of extra energy consuption 
## Applications
* It can be widely used for the household purposes to avoid the wastage of electricity through this small sensor device.
*  A home automation system will provide energy savings by turning off lights when kids or adults forget to shut them off as they leave a room.
