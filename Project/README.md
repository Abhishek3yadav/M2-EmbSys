# Motion Based Home Automation & Temperature Controller

Home automation usage has been on a rise in the recent times. The aim of this project is to make smarter home automation system which can switch light automatically as well as maintain the temperature of the facility in which it is installed. Password based security of the system is also an integrated part of this project. We have a motion sensor and a temperature sensor mounted on the project board.

# High Level Requirements
- An automation device must be able to handle as many tasks and processes as possible quickly, easily and without errors.
- Proper power supply is needed.
- In case of fluctuating the voltage, In-build Inverter can control the voltage.

# Low Level Requirements
* Sensor shall work accordingly
* power supply shall not cut at any time
*
