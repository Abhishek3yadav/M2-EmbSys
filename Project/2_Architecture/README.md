# Components 
## ARDUNIO UNO
* ARDUNIO UNNO is a high performance yet low power consumption  AVR microcontroller that's able to achieve the most single clock cycle execution of 131 powerful instructions     thanks to its advanced RISC architecture.
## A matrix keypad
* It is the kind of keypad you see on microwave ovens, gas pumps, and calculators. A matrix keypad you can connect to a breadboard is also great for prototypes and inventions      where things like codes, times, or other values have to be entered. 

## Relay
Relays are used where it is necessary to control a circuit by an independent low-power signal, or where several circuits must be controlled by one signal

## Temperature sensor
*  it is use to sense the temperature of the room 
*  It is thermistor SENSOR  is used to meausure the room temperature.
## Motion sensor  (ultrasonic as motion)
* A motion sensor (or motion detector) is an electronic device that is designed to detect and measure movement.
*  Motion sensors are used primarily in home and business security systems.

## LCDâ€™s
*  it is a method of displaying readings continuously, as on digital watches, portable computers, and calculators, using a liquid crystal film, sealed between glass plates,         that changes its optical properties when a voltage is applied.
## MOTOR (as load)
* here as load of 5 volt supply motor is used.
